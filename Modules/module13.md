##### BigQuery - Scalable, managed enterprise data warehouse for analytics.
- BigQuery is a fully managed enterprise data warehouse that helps you manage and analyze your data with built-in features like machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.

##### Google cloud Dataproc - Big data platform for running Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark jobs
- Dataproc is a managed Spark and Hadoop service that lets you take advantage of open source data tools for batch processing, querying, streaming, and machine learning. Dataproc automation helps you create clusters quickly, manage them easily, and save money by turning clusters off when you don't need them.

##### Cloud Pub/Sub - Scalable event ingestion service based on message queues.
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub provides messaging between applications. Cloud Pub/Sub is designed to provide reliable, many-to-many, asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher applications can send messages to a "topic" and other applications can subscribe to that topic to receive the messages.

##### Cloud Dataflow - Managed service based on Apache Beam for stream and batch data processing
- GCP Dataflow is a Unified stream and batch data processing that's serverless, fast, and cost-effective. It is a fully managed data processing service and has many other features which you can find on its website here.

##### Cloud Datalab - Tool for data exploration, analysis, visualization and machine learning. This is a fully managed Jupyter Notebook service.
- Google Cloud DataLab is a tool for exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and building machine learning models. It is a powerful BI Engine tool for structured and unstructured data to analyse the patterns in every dataset.

##### Genomics 
- Cloud Life Sciences (formerly Google Genomics) enables the life sciences community to process biomedical data at scale. Cost effective and supported by a growing partner ecosystem, Cloud Life Sciences lets you focus on analyzing data and reproducing results while Google Cloud takes care of the rest.
