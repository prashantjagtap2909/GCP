# What is cloud computing ? 
- Cloud computing is the on-demand delievery of compute power, database storage application and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay as you go pricing.

- It is the use of remote servers on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than a local server on your personal computer.

## In simple word 
-  Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of your computer's hard drive.
- Cloud computing is the use of off-site systems to help computers store, manage, process, and/or communicate information. These off-site systems are hosted on the cloud (or the internet) instead of on your computer or other local storage. They can encompass anything from email servers to software programs, data storage, or even increasing your computer’s processing power.

- The “cloud” is a term that simply means “the internet.” Computing involves the infrastructures and systems that allow a computer to run and build, deploy, or interact with information. In cloud computing, this means that instead of hosting infrastructure, systems, or applications on your hard drive or an on-site server, you’re hosting it on virtual/online servers that connect to your computer through secure networks.
