# GCP regions and zones

- In Google Cloud Region is a geographical region made up of zones where you can host your GCP resources. Google Cloud Zone is a GCP resource deployment area (virtual machine, database..). Within the region, this is regarded as a single failure domain. If you want to achieve high availability and fault tolerance in the same location, you can employ a multi-zone deployment technique.

- There are at least three zones in each region. The main benefit of zones is that they increase availability and fault tolerance within a single region. There are one or more distinctive clusters in each zone (distinct physical infrastructure that is housed in a data centre). One or more data centres can be found in a single zone. Low latency links connect each of the zones in the same region. As a result, we can install a web application in one zone and a database in another without compromising performance.

- Currently, Google Cloud provides 29 Regions, 88 Zones available in 200+ countries and they are adding more regions every year.  You can find up-to-date information on GCP cloud location page.





### There are three main advantages of GCP regions and zones.

- GCP has a number of locations around the world. It also contributes to the applicationâ€™s excellent availability.
- Assists in achieving low latency and serving users from the closest available site.
- Follow the rules set forth by the government. Data policies varies from country to country.
