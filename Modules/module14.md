## Machine Learning: The Storage domain includes services related to machine learning, it includes the following services
- Cloud Machine Learning
- Vision API
- Speech API
- Natural Language API
- Translation API
- Jobs API

###### Cloud Machine Learning Engine - Managed service for training and building machine learning models based on mainstream frameworks.
- The Google Cloud ML Engine is a hosted platform to run machine learning training jobs and predictions at scale. The service treats these two processes (training and predictions) independently. It is possible to use Google Cloud ML Engine just to train a complex model by leveraging the GPU and TPU infrastructure

###### Cloud Vision API - Image analysis service based on machine learning
- The Google Cloud Vision API allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content. In this codelab you will focus on using the Vision API with Python.

###### Cloud Speech-to-Text - Speech to text conversion service based on machine learning.
- Google Cloud Speech API enables developers to convert audio to text by applying powerful neural network models in an easy to use API. The API recognizes over 80 languages and variants, to support your global user base.

##### Cloud Natural Language - Text analysis service based on Google Deep Learning models
- Provide natural language understanding technologies, such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and other text annotations to developers.

##### Cloud Translation API - Service to dynamically translate between thousands of available language pairs
- Google Translate is a multilingual neural machine translation service developed by Google to translate text, documents and websites from one language into another. It offers a website interface, a mobile app for Android and iOS, and an API that helps developers build browser extensions and software applications

##### Jobs api
- The Jobs API allows you to create, edit, and delete jobs. The maximum allowed size of a request to the Jobs API is 10MB.
