# What is the Need of cloud computing


 ## Problems if using local server
### 1.DataBase and security :-
- Weak and Complex DB Infrastructure
- Irregularities in Databases
- Human Error
- Malware


### 2.Managing servers :- 
- Risk and Security Threat
- 24Ã—7 Server Monitoring 
- Server Maintenance


### 3.Increasing cost
- Higher Costs : Servers run on electricity and consume a lot of electricity as they have to be run throughout the day. There also has to be a specialized IT person or team to take care of servers and to maintain it. Other than electricity costs and IT team costs, servers also occupy a lot of storage space thus causing them to spend on office space. Thus a lot of costs are associated with local servers.



### 4.Scalability issue
- It is hard to add or reduce resouces when we need


## Solution

### 1.Database and security :- 
- Since the Cloud suppliers have expertise in data security they are completely aware of the changing standards of cyber-security and hence the complexity of data security is updated from time to time. They provide two-level data security when compared with local servers.


### 2.Dynamically scalable server :- 
- A cloud server is an investment that is a one-time setup. Maintenance, backup, software upgrade and other complex tasks are to be carried out by the supplier. This allows the business to focus on its business and not data servers. The cost is less as the suppliers manage the servers thus internal IT team is not required, electricity costs for running servers are borne by the supplier, security, software and systems have to be handled by the supplier and thus the only expense the business has to pay is for the cloud.


### 3.Remote access device :- 
In the cloud, you can access your files from any device at any time. With remote desktop software, you can access a specific desktop, the files, the applications, and everything else related to that desktop from a remote location.


### 4.Reduced cost and overhead :- 
- A cloud server is an investment that is a one-time setup. Maintenance, backup, software upgrade and other complex tasks are to be carried out by the supplier. This allows the business to focus on its business and not data servers. The cost is less as the suppliers manage the servers thus internal IT team is not required, electricity costs for running servers are borne by the supplier, security, software and systems have to be handled by the supplier and thus the only expense the business has to pay is for the cloud.


### 5.Fast computation :- 
- Cloud computing allows you to deploy your service quickly in fewer clicks. This faster deployment allows you to get the resources required for your system within fewer minutes.
