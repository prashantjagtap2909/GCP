## Networking: The Storage domain includes services related to networking, it includes the following services
- Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Google Cloud Load Balancing
- Content Delivery Network
- Google Cloud Interconnect
- Google Cloud DNS


##### Virtual Private Cloud for managing the software defined network of cloud resources.
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides networking functionality to Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters, and the App Engine flexible environment. VPC provides networking for your cloud-based resources and services that is global, scalable, and flexible.

##### Cloud Load Balancing - Software-defined, managed service for load balancing the traffic.
- A load balancer distributes user traffic across multiple instances of your applications. By spreading the load, load balancing reduces the risk that your applications experience performance issues.

##### Cloud CDN - Content Delivery Network based on Google's globally distributed edge points of presence.
- Cloud CDN is a content delivery network that accelerates your web and video content delivery by using Google's global edge network to bring content as close to your users as possible. As a result latency, cost, and load on your backend servers is reduced, making it easier to scale to millions of users.

##### Cloud Interconnect - Service to connect a data center with Google Cloud Platform
- Cloud Interconnect provides low latency, high availability connections that enable you to reliably transfer data between your on-premises and Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks.

##### Cloud DNS - Managed, authoritative DNS service running on the same infrastructure as Google.
- Google Cloud DNS is a high-performance, resilient, global Domain Name System (DNS) service. To use DNS, open the left side menu of the console, select Networking (under Compute), and then open DNS.
