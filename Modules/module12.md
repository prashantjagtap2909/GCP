## Storage and Databases: The Storage domain includes services related to data storage, it includes the following services
- Google Cloud Storage 
- Cloud Bigtable
- Google Cloud Datastore
- Cloud SQL
- Persistent Disk

##### Cloud Storage - Object storage with integrated edge caching to store unstructured data.
- Cloud Storage is a service for storing your objects in Google Cloud. An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format. You store objects in containers called buckets.

##### Cloud Bigtable - Managed NoSQL database service
- Cloud Bigtable is a sparsely populated table that can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns, enabling you to store terabytes or even petabytes of data. A single value in each row is indexed; this value is known as the row key.

##### Cloud Datastore - NoSQL database for web and mobile applications
- Cloud Datastore is a schemaless NoSQL datastore in Google's cloud. Applications can use Datastore to query your data with SQL-like queries that support filtering and sorting. Datastore replicates data across multiple datacenters, which provides a high level of read/write availability.

##### Cloud SQL - Database as a Service based on MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server.
- Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that helps you set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases on Google Cloud Platform. You can use Cloud SQL with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.

##### Persistent Disk - Block storage for Compute Engine virtual machines
- Persistent disks are durable network storage devices that your instances can access like physical disks in a desktop or a server. The data on each persistent disk is distributed across several physical disks.
