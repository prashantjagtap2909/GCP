###### Compute Engine - Infrastructure as a Service to run Microsoft Windows and Linux virtual machines.
- Compute Engine is a customizable compute service that lets you create and run virtual machines on Google's infrastructure. You can create a Virtual Machine (VM) that fits your needs.
###### App Engine - Platform as a Service to deploy Java, PHP, Node.js, Python, C#, .Net, Ruby and Go applications.
- App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. You can choose from several popular languages, libraries, and frameworks to develop your apps, and then let App Engine take care of provisioning servers and scaling your app instances based on demand.
###### Container Engine - Containers as a Service based on Kubernetes.
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a management and orchestration system for Docker container and container clusters that run within Google's public cloud services. Google Kubernetes Engine is based on Kubernetes, Google's open source container management system.
###### Container Registry - 
- Container Registry is a service for storing private container images. It provides a subset of features provided by Artifact Registry, a universal repository manager and the recommended service for managing container images and other artifacts in Google Cloud.
###### Cloud Functions - Functions as a Service to run event-driven code written in Node.js, Java, Python, or Go.
- Cloud Functions is an event-driven serverless compute platform. Cloud Functions allows you to write your code without worrying about provisioning resources or scaling to handle changing requirements.
