# Why GCP
- Google cloud platform is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end user product like Google search, Gmail, Youtube , Google photos etc.

- cost effective 
- Highly scalable 
- Custom machine type
- IOT
- AM platform and ecosystem
- Cloud AI
- Serverless
- Big data analytic



- It has better pricing compared to its competitor cloud solutions. It offers cost effective solutions for various use cases.
- It is very fast which increases performance of executing the project.
- It offers live migration of applications.
- GCP provides innovative solutions in Big data, AI and machine learning in comparison to other competitors.
- It offers many benefits such as high productivity, work from anywhere, quick collaboration, high security, fewer data stored on vulnerable devices, reliable resources to be used by geographically distributed organizations.
- It is very flexible and hence organizations can scale up and down use of services and resources as per their requirements.


## Advantages over other cloud service

#### Better Pricing
- With a LOLpay-as-you-use service (charged according to time and resources), you only have to worry about the demand. The hassle that comes with running and maintaining on-premise hardware falls away and best of all, discounts are offered based on extensive usage.

- GCP even ranks as a more affordable and cost-friendly option over their largest rivals, AWS and Microsoft Azure. “To start off, instances are simply lower in cost on Google Cloud Platform, Compute Engine alone is typically between 40% – 50% cheaper than AWS and Azure”.

#### Live Virtual Machine Migration
- Live Virtual Machine (VM) migration is highly beneficial to administrators and engineers, as it keeps systems running smoothly during infrastructure upgrades and maintenance. It also ensures that your VMs and software remain protected and operating efficiently during hardware or software failures.

- What’s interesting is that none of their competitors offer this functionality. While Azure, AWS and other smaller cloud providers do offer VMs, they don’t offer live migration of those VMs.

#### Powerful Security
- Google has over 15 years of knowledge and experience in state-of-the-art security. They have access to top-tier security professionals and have secured the services that they offer the public for years now. Think about the levels of security required for Gmail, Youtube and their search engine. They essentially share that with your organisation.

- Google also encrypts their data under 256-bit AES. They ensure that “every encryption key is also encrypted with a set of regularly changed master keys”. Their relationships with the largest ISPs across the world also helps improve security by preventing exposure to the public internet.

#### Superb Backups
- Even in the case of a disaster, GCP ensures that you will never lose your data. With four different types of storage, it stores your data redundantly (between two or more different places). So if anything were to happen, there are always numerous backups available.

- By making use of its multi-regional storage function, your data is stored in at least two separate regions. This keeps it safe from any influence (internal or external). 

- If that hasn’t convinced you to make GCP your cloud provider, then we have a few more advantages to consider.

- Net Solutions highlights some fantastic benefits

#### Increased Productivity
- With GCP’s systems offering efficient and regular updates, innovation is easier to achieve. Because of this, there’s an increase in overall productivity and the amount of changes that can be made on the fly. 

- Also, the fact that employees can work (and collaborate) from pretty much any location around the world improves both morale and overall output.

#### A Customer-Centered Approach
- Google prides themselves on providing an enjoyable and comfortable user experience to all of their customers. So it’s safe to assume that GCP would do the same.

- One of the great things about GCP is that when they make changes and improvements, they ensure that those tweaks are manageable and don’t disrupt or confuse the user in any way. They also give their customers more reliability in the case of failures or disasters by immediately allowing backups to a secondary centre without interruption.


## What is Google Cloud Platform?
- It provides reliable and highly scalable Google cloud computing services to its users. These services help clients compute and store data, and help developers build, test, and deploy apps. Google cloud platform covers application, storage, and cloud computing services for backend, mobile, and web solutions using the internet. More than four million apps trust and use the platform.

- Google tries to keep the backend as simple as possible and uses a simple file system. This system is the foundation of the Google cloud services. It handles requests for information via basic commands like write, read, and open. It is a distributed system of computing.

- Google Cloud has recently acquired Cornerstone Technology to assist customers in migrating their mainframe workloads to Google Cloud Platform. Many small and large enterprises are increasingly adopting the Google Cloud Platform, which bodes well since it disentangles things and makes them more secure at reasonable costs.
